I am a chemical engineer by training, with a passion for advancing the fundamental understanding of materials at the atomic scale. My fascination with atoms dates back to high school, and this early curiosity guided my academic journey. I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering at Jadavpur University in Kolkata, India — home to the oldest chemical engineering department in Asia. Afterward, I pursued a master’s degree at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India.

As fate would have it, during my time at IISc, I was reintroduced to the world of atoms and computer simulations. That dormant interest was instantly rekindled, drawing me once more into the captivating realm of atomic-scale science. Under the guidance of Dr. Ananth Govind Rajan in the Department of Chemical Engineering at IISc, I worked on predicting nanopore shapes in 2D materials using ab initio methods. Since then, I have actively researched electronic structure theory-based methods and their applications to solve scientific problems. Currently, I am a doctoral candidate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA. I am keenly interested in atomistic simulations and in modeling and simulation of materials. I collaborate with two research groups: the Material Physics & Mechanics Group led by Dr. Phanish Suryanarayana, and the Medford Group led by Dr. Andrew J. Medford, who both serve as my PhD advisors.

After gaining hands-on experience with experimental research during my undergraduate, I pivoted fully to computational chemistry during my masters, applying density functional theory (DFT) to study 2D materials. However, driven by a desire to move beyond black-box applications and to deeply understand the theory and algorithms behind DFT, I am now a contributing developer of SPARC, an open source DFT code as part of my PhD research. My work bridges practical applications with a rigorous exploration of electronic structure methods, pushing the boundaries of computational materials science.

Beyond my research, I have always loved mathematics and enjoy tackling challenging problems. My hobbies include reading and painting. Although I do not consider myself an avid reader, I enjoy getting lost in storybooks. Since joining IISc, I have taken up painting more regularly, which has become a favorite way to spend weekends and holidays. I also love to travel, experience new places, and immerse myself in their cultures. 

This is where you’ll find what I do 9–5 — from developing DFT code to unraveling the physico-chemical behavior of materials, and everything in between. Cheers!
